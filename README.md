#Do Certain Song Characteristics Impact Likelihood of Winning a Grammy Award?
##Our Selected Topic
Using datasets scraped from grammy.com, a graduate music and data analysis project at California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo, and sourced from kaggle.com, we set out to determine whether or not certain song characteristics could predict whether or not a song, if nominated, is likely to win "Song of the Year."

##Reason for Data Selection
While one group member is a musician, the saying goes that music is a universal language. It may be both useful and fascinating to determine whether or not certain objective and subjective song factors can help predict whether nominated songs will win.

##Source Data
Source data was originally scraped from grammy.com, compiled by a graduate music and data analysis project at California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo, and these and a few other tables were sourced from kaggle.com.

##Communication Protocols
We will primarily communicate utilizing an iMessage thread titled Team KaRiBe, updating each other as deliverable progress is made. Zoom is also used for more direct communciation and explanation, while easy link and file sharing is done through Slack.

###Note: this was not our original project idea. Benjamin Rathke (author of this readme) originally sourced data from COVID-19 data and statistics, but that data did not lend itself well to the machine learning models the group wished to employ.
