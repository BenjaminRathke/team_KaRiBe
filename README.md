# Does Demographic Data Accurately Predict Vaccination Stauts?

## Our Selected Topic
Using a dataset from the CDC, we will be using a supervised linear regression model to attempt to ask the question:  do demographic characteristics such as race and age group accurately predict the likelihood of full vaccination?  

## Reason for Data Selection
This is a very topical data set right now, from the standpoint of basic public health, politically, and sociologically.  What demographic factors may contribute to vaccination resistance?

## Source Data
Source data comes from CDC data on vaccination rates and demographic information.  Demographic information is reported as a total of vaccinated persons by date and what category they may fall into; it does not provide demographic information by each person vaccinated.  We will need to adjust the data and likely remove several factors to answer the question posed.  As our group studies the data, manipulation and clean up methods will become clearer.  Additional or completely different datasets may need to be sourced to have a more robust set of features with which to create accurate models for prediction.

## Communication Protocols
We will primarily communicate utilizing an iMessage thread titled Team KaRiBe, updating each other as deliverable progress is made.
