# Proposed New Project  
* Datasets are included in this resources folder to create the new database schema/tables, merge, clean, and transform the data in the datasets, and perform a logistic regression on the final usable dataset.  

* There should be 5 tables in the database, one for each of the .csv files here.  

* The "songdata_cleaned.csv" contains appropriate data for a logistic regression model.  The target (y) value will be the "winner" column, and the features (X) will be everything else.
